11. Supplementary Examination:<br>
During the Supplementary Examination, the student shall answer only the end-semester component. The in-semester marks are carried forward. There should be at least 15 days period between the date of declaration of the Even semester examination results and the conduct of Supplementary examinations. The result of the supplementary examination be declared preferably before the commencement of the new academic year and in no circumstances after the last day of admissions, so as to enable a student to enroll for the higher class after passing the course. Students who do not obtain the minimum grade of D after the supplementary examination have to repeat the end-semester course assessment only with the next batch till they obtain minimum D grade required for passing.<br /><br />
SCHEME OF GRADING, CLASS &amp; GRACING FOR BCA<br /><br />
1. Grading Scheme<br /><br />
Absolute grading scheme is followed to compute the grade for each course.<br /><br />
The final grade for the course is awarded by the Instructor-in-charge / course coordinator taking into account the collective performance in the In-Semester and End-Semester.<br /><br />
For each course taken by the student, a letter grade is assigned based on the performance in all assessments. Each grade not only indicates a qualitative assessment of the students' performance but also carries an equivalent number called the grade point. The absolute grading range in terms of marks and the corresponding grade point are shown in the table below<br /><br />


<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="65">Letter Grade</td>
<td width="60">Grade point</td>
<td width="161">Range for Total % Marks</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="65">A</td>
<td width="60">10</td>
<td width="161">86 – 100</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="65">B</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td width="65">F</td>
<td width="60">0</td>
<td width="161">Less than 40</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<br /><br />A candidate passes the course if he/she gets any grade in the range between A and D.<br>
A candidate is awarded F grade on account of overall poor performance (total marks less than 40) or failure to appear for the end-semester examination.<br>
If a candidate is awarded F grade after the end-semester examination, he/she has to appear for the Supplementary Examination conducted at the end of that academic year.<br>
If a candidate is awarded F grade after the Supplementary examination, he/she has to repeat only the end-semester component when that course is being offered next.<br>
If a candidate is absent for the Supplementary examination, he/she will get a F grade and has to repeat only the end-semester component when that course is being offered next.<br /><br />
2. Performance Indices<br>
i) Semester Performance Index (SPI): The performance of a student in a semester is indicated by a number called SPI. The SPI is the weighted average of the grade points obtained in all the courses during the semester. SPI is to be calculated as<br>
SPI = ?Gradepoint X course credit/? credits of each course in semester SPI has to be rounded to two decimal digits.<br>
ii) Cumulative Performance Index (CPI): The overall performance of a student at a particular point during the entire programme is obtained by calculating a number called CPI. The CPI of a particular semester is the weighted average of the grade points obtained in all the courses for the programme till that semester. The CPI is also calculated to two decimal places.<br>
iii) Conversion of CPI into Percentage for the BCA Course: In cases where an employer or an institute needs the equivalent percentage they can use the following formula to get an approximate idea of the percentage equivalent for the CPI score –<br>
Equivalent Percentage = CPI score * 10<br>
For e.g. if CPI = 5.67, then equivalent percentage = 5.67 * 10 = 56.7%<br /><br />
3. Award of class: Each semester grade report for the student shall carry his/her SPI and CPI<br>
The final class for the BCA degree would be awarded based on CPI of final semester as per the following scheme:<br>
Distinction: CPI equal to or greater than 7.0<br>
First class: CPI equal to or greater than 6.0 but less than 7.0 Second Class: CPI equal to or greater than 5.0 but less than 6.0 Pass Class: CPI equal to or greater than 4.0 but less than 5.0<br /><br />
4. GRACING: Due to the grading scheme adopted, there is no provision for gracing in the individual course. However, entitlement marks awarded by Goa University for candidates due to NSS, NCC, Sports or cultural activities shall be added to the total before calculating CPI at the end of each semester.<br /><br />
Attempts and Improvement of class</strong><br /><br />
i) Attempts: A student shall be considered to have passed a course at first attempt, provided he/she passes with a letter grade of D or higher, at the regular examination.<br /><br />
ii) In addition to the above, a candidate who was absent for the regular end semester examination on valid grounds and later passes the course after appearing for the Supplementary examination shall be considered to have passed the course at first attempt.
<br /><br />
iii) All other cases would be treated as second attempts and indicated on the grade sheet.<br /><br />
iv) A candidate is allowed to repeat an entire year (Even and Odd Semester) in order to improve his/her performance. In such a situation the better of the two performances shall be considered. This facility shall be permitted only once in the BCA programme and the Statement of marks shall bear the sentence "Under Improvement". The candidate shall be required to surrender the original grade sheet and other relevant documents at the time of receiving the fresh Grade sheet in the event of improvement of performance for each concerned semester. The better of the two performances for each semester shall be considered.<br /><br />
REVALUATION &amp; PERSONAL VERIFICATION OF MARKS<br /><br />
There shall be no revaluation of answer books of the candidates at the End-semester examination, except for Semester V and VI. Personal verification of marks shall be granted to the candidate, provided he/she had applied for the same along with the payment of prescribed fees within one week of the declaration of results. The procedure for the verification of marks is as follows:
<br /><br />• On a notified day and time, not later than 10 days after the receipt of application from the candidate, the candidate will be shown the answer book in the chamber of the Principal/Vice- Principal in the presence of the examiner concerned.
<br /><br />• If the candidate is not satisfied with the results of personal verification, he/she may apply to the Principal for looking into the grievance.
